\textbf{RQ2.} what is the uncertainty in some spatio-temporal locations not previously analyzed?

\section{Spatio-temporal Interpolation}
However, adding the temporal domain implies that variability in space and time must be modelled, which is more complicated than modelling purely spatial or purely temporal variability \cite{Graler2016}.
