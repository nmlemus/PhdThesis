\section{Introduction}
To create a data model to our Uncertainty Quantification Management System (UQMS), we need to start with the definition of all the concepts that are related to the UQ process. As we talk before, from a very general point of view, we can simplify the UQ problem as follow:

Given a mathematical model, 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{Y}=\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{P})
\end{equation}
where: \\
I: parameter inputs that are certain. \\
P: set of input parameters that are uncertain. \\
M: mathematical model, and \\
Y: output (quantities of interes)
